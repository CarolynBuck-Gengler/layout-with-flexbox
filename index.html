            <header>Hi, I'm Carolyn.</header>
            <main>
                <p>I am Web Developer with a background in Cognitive Psychology and programming experiments. Like
                many I'm having to make the best of it during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                <br>One thing that has drawn my interest lately is jsPsych, a Javascript library explicitly developed
                    to help psychology researchers put some of their experiments online. I hope to maybe someday
                    combine my love of programming and developing websites with my research and experiment background
                    by writing online experiments using jsPsych.
                <br>But in the meantime...</p>

                <p>During the pandemic, one thing our family has really gotten into
                    is bicycling. It started in March when we went for a walk
                    every day, for exercise and to take a break. We started with short walks but 
                    soon built it up to an hour. When the weather got warm enough, we swapped our 
                    walking shoes for our bicycles, because we could go so much farther! Now
                    we get in an hour-long ride 4 to 5 times each week, trying to get to different parts of our city;
                    on Sundays we go nearly 2 hours. We always go early in the morning to avoid the 
                    heat later in the day. It's been a wonderful new family activity!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p>Another thing I've taken up during this time is baking, especially bread.
                    I was never a bread baker before, but I found recipes that didn't require 
                    kneading, and the bread is baked in my Dutch oven. I've been working with one main recipe,
                    trying to perfect my execution of it, and then branching out with greater proportions
                    of whole wheat flour, and even adding herbs and seeds. I'm also trying other
                    recipes, such as a dill-cottage cheese bread and a honey whole wheat bread. I even 
                    got myself a new smaller Dutch oven. It seems like a lot of people are doing this, because 
                    some ingredients (e.g., flour and yeast) have been hard to find at times; I still haven't been able
                    to get vital wheat gluten. If this keeps up, I'll have to open a bakery!</p>

                <p>Lastly, in the evenings we've been binging a lot of movies and TV shows we missed
                    in the past. We got Disney+ and CBS All Access to see 
                    <span class='movie-name'>The Mandelorian</span>, 
                    <span class='movie-name'>Clone Wars</span>,
                    <span class='movie-name'>Picard</span>, 
                    <span class='movie-name'>Star Trek: Discovery</span>, and 
                    <span class='movie-name'>Star Trek: Enterprise</span>; and a couple weeks ago
                    were thrilled to be able to watch <span class='movie-name'>Hamilton</span>. 
                    We also watched several of the Andrew Lloyd Weber musicals (including 
                    <span class='movie-name'>Cats</span> and 
                    <span class='movie-name'>Phantom of the Opera</span>) when they were aired, and even 
                    some ballet versions of <span class='movie-name'>Romeo and Juliet</span>.
                    Now we are catching up on <span class='movie-name'>Star Trek: Next Generation</span> 
                    and <span class='movie-name'>Deep Space Nine</span>.</p>
